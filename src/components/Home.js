        Hello, My name is Link (He/They) I am an up and coming developer just beginning to apply my newly learned coding abilities.<br></br><br /> Most of my experience is in the food industry with about 12 years
        under my belt. <br></br><br />I've relocated from Toronto to Vancouver for a little while and hoping for the best while I'm here.<br></br><br /> My hopes are to continue practicing my code developing skills and apply my skills
        in community settings where they can help people organize. <br></br><br />I am passionate about accessible health care and equality for Trans people and push to remain visible so that trans youth and the general public
        may have another <a href="https://www.azquotes.com/picture-quotes/quote-i-would-never-be-so-arrogant-to-think-that-someone-should-model-their-life-after-me-laverne-cox-88-32-26.jpg">possibility model</a> available to them. <br></br><br /> 
        I like spending time in nature and practicing my DJ mixing skills with a recent beginners controller.
